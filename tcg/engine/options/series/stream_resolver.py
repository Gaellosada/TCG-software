"""Materialise a single option-stream time series.

This is the engine-layer counterpart of the API ``OptionStreamRef``
SeriesRef variant.  Given a list of trade dates plus a selection
criterion, maturity rule, root, type, optional cycle filter, and a
target stream label, it produces a dense ``float64`` array (one value
per date, NaN where the value is missing or the selection failed) and
a parallel ``error_code`` list (None on success, otherwise a string
diagnostic).

Independence
------------
This module imports **only** from ``tcg.types.options`` and
``tcg.engine.options.*`` — never from ``tcg.data.*`` and never from
``tcg.core.*``.  The import-linter ``engine-data-isolation`` contract
is the binding constraint.  The wiring layer in
``tcg.core.api.indicators`` translates the Pydantic SeriesRef
(carrying Pydantic v2 ``MaturityRule`` / ``SelectionCriterion``) into
the dataclass twins from ``tcg.types.options`` before calling
:func:`resolve_option_stream`.

Cycle filtering
---------------
``DefaultOptionsSelector.select`` calls ``ChainReaderPort.query_chain``
without passing ``expiration_cycle``.  To honour a caller-supplied
``cycle`` we wrap the injected reader in a thin proxy that always
passes the chosen cycle through.  ``cycle=None`` is a pass-through
(no filter applied).  See guardrail 11 — cycle is first-class.

Per-date call count and concurrency (no batching available)
------------------------------------------------------------
The data layer exposes no date-range chain query — see recon doc and
``tcg.data.options.protocol.OptionsDataReader.query_chain``.  This
materialiser issues, per trade date::

    if maturity == NearestToTarget:   2 chain queries
        - one wide-window probe (selector resolves expirations)
        - one narrow-window query at the resolved expiration
        (the per-request ``CachedChainReader`` may coalesce these
         when keys match — currently they differ, see _options_wiring)
    else:                             1 chain query
        - direct query at the resolved expiration

For an N-day backtest this is N (or 2N for NearestToTarget) Mongo
round-trips.  The per-date tasks run **concurrently** under
``asyncio.gather`` with a bounded semaphore (see
:data:`_MAX_INFLIGHT_PER_DATE`) — wall-clock latency is therefore
roughly ``ceil(N / _MAX_INFLIGHT_PER_DATE) × Mongo_RTT``, not
``N × Mongo_RTT`` as a serial loop would give.  Total query count is
unchanged from the serial loop.
