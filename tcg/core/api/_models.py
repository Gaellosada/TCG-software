"""Shared Pydantic request models for instrument / series references.

Both the signals and indicators routers accept the same shape for
identifying an instrument — either a spot instrument (collection +
instrument_id), a rolled continuous futures stream (collection +
adjustment + cycle + roll offset + strategy), or an options-derived
stream (root + option_type + maturity + selection + stream).  Keeping
the schema in one place guarantees the routers can't drift apart and
lets adapters consume any shape without reimporting.

The options variant — :class:`OptionStreamRef` — REUSES the existing
discriminated unions from ``tcg.core.api._models_options``
(:data:`MaturityRule`, :data:`SelectionCriterion`) rather than
redeclaring them.  See guardrail 2 in the task brief.
